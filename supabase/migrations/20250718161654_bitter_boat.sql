/*
  # Team Members Functionality Schema

  1. New Tables
    - `workspace_users` - Links users to workspaces with roles
    - Updates to existing tables to support multi-user access

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add policies for workspace-based access control
    - Users can only see data from workspaces they belong to

  3. Changes
    - Add proper foreign key relationships
    - Add indexes for performance
    - Add role-based access policies
