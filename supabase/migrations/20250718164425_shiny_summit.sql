/*
  # Remove All Recursive RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - Infinite recursion detected in workspace_users policies
    - Policies are creating circular dependencies between tables
    - Complex subqueries causing performance issues

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing policies that cause recursion
    - Create simple, direct policies without circular references
    - Use auth.uid() directly where possible
    - Avoid complex joins in RLS policies

  3. Security
    - Maintain workspace isolation
    - Ensure users can only access their workspace data
    - Keep role-based permissions simple
